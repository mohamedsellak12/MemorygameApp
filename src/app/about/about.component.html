  <h1>About the Game</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the <strong>Memory Match Football Edition</strong>!</p>
  
  <p>In this game, your goal is to find the two matching cards featuring the same football player. Each card displays an image of a football player, and your task is to remember the positions of the cards and match them correctly before the time runs out.</p>

  <p><strong>Game Rules:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The game consists of 24 cards, each with a football player's image on one side.</li>
    <li>You will need to find the two cards that match by flipping them over one at a time.</li>
    <li>If the two cards match, they remain face up. If they don't, they are flipped back down.</li>
    <li>You have <strong>3 minutes</strong> to match all cards! The game ends either when all cards are matched or when the timer reaches 0.</li>
  </ul>
